#ngx-http-promises

I really like [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/), but after attending [ng-conf 2022](https://2022.ng-conf.org/), learned that a lot of you do not.  The goal of this project is to provide the thinnest possible wrapper for [HttpClient](https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpClient) that will result in a [Promise-oriented](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) client.
